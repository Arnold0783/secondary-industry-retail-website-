As part of my learning journey, I designed a modern UX for Proton Bakeries' website, focusing on improving user experience and functionality. The website includes a homepage, product showroom, about and contact sections, a shopping page (open for improvement), and a receipt system. I enjoy exploring ways to help companies adopt modern technologies through creative designs. I'm excited to apply my growing skills to meaningful projects and contribute to teams that value innovation and creativity in web design.
